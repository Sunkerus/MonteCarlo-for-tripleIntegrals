# MonteCarlo-for-tripleIntegrals

---

This is simple project for calculating the volume of a cube with **MonteCarlo** method written on C++  
The task is described by mathematical model, using a random variable generator, the model repeatedly calculated and on the basis of the obtained data are calculated  

Probabilistic characteristics of the process under consideration.
